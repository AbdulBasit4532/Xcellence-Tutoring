# How to Deploy Xcellence Tutoring Website

Your website is ready to go live! The easiest (and free) way to host it is using **Netlify**.

## 🚀 Option 1: Drag & Drop (Easiest)

1.  **Open this Link**: Go to **[https://app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)** in your browser.
2.  **Locate Your Folder**: Open your File Explorer to your Desktop.
3.  **Drag & Drop**: Click and drag the entire **`Xcellence Tutoring`** folder onto the circle on the Netlify page.
4.  **Wait**: It will upload in a few seconds.
5.  **Done!** Netlify will give you a live URL (e.g., `https://random-name-123.netlify.app`).

## ⚙️ Post-Deployment Settings (Recommended)

1.  **Rename Site**:
    *   Click "Site Settings" > "Change site name".
    *   Change it to something professional like `xcellence-tutoring`.
    *   Your new link will be `https://xcellence-tutoring.netlify.app`.

2.  **Custom Domain** (Optional):
    *   If you own a domain (like `xcellencetutoring.com`), you can connect it in "Domain Management".

## 📧 Important Note for EmailJS
Your EmailJS integration will work on the live site **automatically**. You do NOT need to change anything.

## 📱 Mobile Testing
Once live, open the link on your phone to double-check everything looks perfect!
